## Synopsis

This app is a simple program that allows you to add workouts with reps and sets, along with keeping track of the dates that you exercised.  It is intended to be a simple layout to keep you focused on the exercising and not distracted by the app itself.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I want to use this project as an opportunity to write an application in HAML and to experiment with the simple_form gem to help me build cleaner looking forms.  I also felt that being a web developer is hard on the body thus I must fight back.  This project is to be a personal workout log to help me keep track of my daily exercise along with adding features to track my long term exercise goals.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/downeyd27/workout-log.git
